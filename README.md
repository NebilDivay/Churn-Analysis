# Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy
Project Overview

This repository contains the core analytical artifact (Churn_Analysis.pbix) used to understand, quantify, and address customer attrition. The project's goal is to identify the structural drivers of customer churn and provide data-backed recommendations for immediate retention strategy adjustments.

The analysis is based on a dataset of 7,043 customers, showing an overall churn rate of 26.55%.
##Key Analytical Findings

The dashboard reveals that churn is not random, but concentrated in three specific, high-leverage areas. Fixing these structural issues will have the greatest impact on long-term retention.
###1. The Contract Volatility Trap (The Primary Driver)

Contract Type
	

% of Total Churn
	

Finding

Month-to-Month
	

88.5%
	

This contract type is the single largest predictor of churn. Customers on flexible plans are inherently unstable.

One Year / Two Year
	

11.5%
	

Longer-term contracts are highly effective retention mechanisms.
###2. The Service Protection Gap

Customers are leaving due to a perceived lack of safety net and support when issues arise.

    No Technical Support: Lacking Tech Support accounts for a massive number of churners (1,448).

    No Device Protection: Similarly, lacking Device Protection is a major contributing factor (1,392 churners).

    Fiber Optic and Electronic Check: These services/payment methods show a higher presence among churners, suggesting potential reliability issues or payment friction.

###3. The Early Tenure Exit

Customer loyalty is extremely fragile during the initial period of the relationship.

    Vulnerability Window: The vast majority of early churn occurs within the 0â€“10 month tenure window.

    Stability: Churn risk drops dramatically once customers are retained past the one-year mark.

##Strategic Action Recommendations (3-Pillar Strategy)

Based on the quantitative findings, three focused strategic pillars are recommended for immediate implementation:



###Pillar 1: Convert
	

Structural Stability
	

Launch aggressive, high-value incentives to migrate all Month-to-Month customers to 1- or 2-year contracts.

###Pillar 2: Embed
	

Confidence & Risk Reduction
	

Bundle or deeply subsidize Tech Support and Device Protection into core plans, making them standard components rather than optional add-ons.

###Pillar 3: Stabilize
	

New Customer Loyalty
	

Implement a high-touch, mandatory 90-day onboarding and retention campaign focused specifically on resolving friction points for customers in their first year.
