# Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy
## Project Overview

This repository contains the core analytical artifact (Churn_Analysis.pbix) used to understand, quantify, and address customer attrition. The project's goal is to identify the structural drivers of customer churn and provide data-backed recommendations for immediate retention strategy adjustments.

The analysis is based on a dataset of 6,418 customers, showing an overall churn rate of 26.98%.
## Key Analytical Findings


### 1. The Contract Volatility Trap (The Primary Driver)

#### Contract Type: Month-to-Month
	

% of Total Finding: 42.5%
	

Finding: 
This contract type is the single largest predictor of churn. Customers on flexible plans are inherently unstable.


	


	


#### Contract Type: One Year / Two Year
	

% of Total Finding: 13.7%
	

Finding: Longer-term contracts are highly effective retention mechanisms.
### 2. The Service Protection Gap

Key takeaway: Competition and service dissatisfaction cause nearly 80% of all voluntary churn.
Competitor offerings
~43%
Product / Network issues
~35%
Price sensitivity
~11%
Customer attitude / Other
~11%



### 3. The Early Tenure Exit

Customer loyalty is extremely fragile during the initial period of the relationship.

    Vulnerability Window: The vast majority of early churn occurs within the 0–15 month tenure window.

    Stability: Churn risk drops dramatically once customers are retained past the one-year mark.

## Strategic Action Recommendations (3-Pillar Strategy)

Based on the quantitative findings, three focused strategic pillars are recommended for immediate implementation:



### Pillar 1: Convert
	

A. Push Multi-Year Contracts
	

Offer loyalty points, small discounts, or exclusive perks for annual renewals.

### Pillar 2: Upsell 
	

Fiber customers produce the highest ARPU, but still churn around 30%.
 Give them the VIP treatment:
Priority customer support


Loyalty rewards


Free device protection upgrades


### Pillar 3: Stabilize
	

Solve Churn Root Causes
Competitor issues: Improve pricing competitiveness and bundle value.


Dissatisfaction: Strengthen network reliability and send proactive outage alerts.


Price concerns: Offer mid-cycle discounts or flexible payment plans.
